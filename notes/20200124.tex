We can do some fun stuff in Mathematica. (***)

\begin{proposition}
	A commutative ring with identity $R$ that does not have any proper ideals is a field. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	We show that every element in $R$ is a unit. 
	
	Consider $I=aR$. Since $R$ only has trivial ideals, $aR=R$. Since $1\in R$, there exists a solution to $ax=1$, so $a$ is a unit. 
\end{proof}
